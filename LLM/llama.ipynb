      "**Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) Concept**\n",
      "\n",
      "Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects and classes. It's a way of designing, organizing, and writing code to create reusable and modular software systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The four fundamental principles of OOPS are:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Encapsulation\n",
      "\n",
      "Encapsulation is the idea of bundling data and its methods that operate on that data within a single unit called an object. This helps hide the implementation details of an object from the outside world, making it easier to modify or replace the object without affecting other parts of the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class BankAccount:\n",
      "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
      "        self.__balance = balance\n",
      "\n",
      "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
      "        if amount > 0:\n",
      "            self.__balance += amount\n",
      "        else:\n",
      "            raise ValueError(\"Invalid deposit amount\")\n",
      "\n",
      "# accessing private attribute using getter/setter\n",
      "account = BankAccount(100)\n",
      "print(account.get_balance())  # prints 100\n",
      "```\n",
      "In this example, the `BankAccount` class encapsulates the `balance` data and provides a public method (`deposit`) to modify it. The actual value of `__balance` is hidden from external access.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Abstraction\n",
      "\n",
      "Abstraction is the practice of showing only necessary information to the outside world while hiding unnecessary details. This helps reduce complexity and make code more modular.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class Car:\n",
      "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
      "        self.__color = color\n",
      "\n",
      "    def drive(self):\n",
      "        print(\"Vroom!\")\n",
      "\n",
      "# using abstraction to get car's color without accessing private attribute\n",
      "my_car = Car(\"Red\")\n",
      "print(my_car.color)  # prints Red (no access to internal data)\n",
      "```\n",
      "In this example, the `Car` class provides an abstract interface (`drive`) that doesn't reveal its internal implementation details.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Inheritance\n",
      "\n",
      "Inheritance is a mechanism where one object can inherit properties and behavior from another object. This helps create a hierarchy of classes with shared characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class Animal:\n",
      "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
      "        self.name = name\n",
      "\n",
      "    def eat(self):\n",
      "        print(\"Eating...\")\n",
      "\n",
      "class Dog(Animal):\n",
      "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
      "        super().__init__(name)\n",
      "        self.breed = breed\n",
      "\n",
      "    def bark(self):\n",
      "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
      "\n",
      "# creating a dog object that inherits from animal\n",
      "my_dog = Dog(\"Fido\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
      "print(my_dog.name)  # prints Fido (inherits name attribute)\n",
      "```\n",
      "In this example, the `Dog` class inherits properties and behavior from the `Animal` class using inheritance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Polymorphism\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This can be achieved through method overriding or method overloading.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class Shape:\n",
      "    def area(self):\n",
      "        pass\n",
      "\n",
      "class Circle(Shape):\n",
      "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
      "        self.radius = radius\n",
      "\n",
      "    def area(self):\n",
      "        return 3.14 * (self.radius ** 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
      "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
      "        self.width = width\n",
      "        self.height = height\n",
      "\n",
      "    def area(self):\n",
      "        return self.width * self.height\n",
      "\n",
      "# creating shape objects that can take on multiple forms\n",
      "circle = Circle(5)\n",
      "print(circle.area())  # prints πr^2 (polymorphic call)\n",
      "\n",
      "rectangle = Rectangle(4, 6)\n",
      "print(rectangle.area())  # prints width × height (polymorphic call)\n",
      "```\n",
      "In this example, the `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes override the `area()` method to provide their own implementation. This demonstrates polymorphism through method overriding.\n",
      "\n",
      "These four fundamental principles of OOPS (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism) are essential for designing robust, modular, and maintainable software systems.\n"
